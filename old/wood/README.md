For whichever build you are doing, print out the appropriate .pdf in 1 to 1 scale, cut out the templates, tape them together, and use them to transfer information to the wood and then drill all the holes. A hand drill is sufficient for this build.  Use #6 wood screws to attach 3d printed brackets to the wood and 3/4" long 4-40 brass socket head screws to attach the die-cast aluminum enclosure to the board. Brass Flared-Collar Knurled-Head Thumb Screws 10-32 Thread Size, 3/4" Long, McMaster Carr part number 92421A645 is used to mount the instrument in a 19 inch rack mount, assuming 10-32 threads on the rack.
