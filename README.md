# Build Instructions

1. Cut the wood board and drill out the holes in it
2. Machine out the Bud box if you are not getting that done by a shop
3. Print the 3d printed parts and add thread inserts
4. Assemble shield board
5. Assemble DC DC converter System, set the voltage with the potentiometer and test
6. Assemble DB25 relay board other than the DB25 connector
7. Put the DB25 connector into the lid, add insulating tape to the lid, and finish the assembly
8. Finish the whole assembly of the BUD box, the Front Panel board, the Arduino mount, Arduino, Arduino shield, and cables
9. Connect Arduino UNO, program it, and test it
10. Assemble the DC cold control board
11. Machine the brass parts for the cryogenic assembly
11. Assemble the assembly
